# Profile-Generator

## Purpose:
This program is to create a simple PDF of a GitHub user. It grabs their public repos, follower, following, stars, location, and GitHub URL. If a user needed to quickly send someone a general pdf of their work, they may be able to simply enter their name and color choice.

### Commits and Issues:
1:  Pass code to desktop.
2:  Code creates a pdf and seems to be working. Issues: Bio not working, stars not working. 
3:  More or less working completely. PDF isn't what the html looks like. Issue with the html to pdf npm. Couldn't find a better one. Electron-html-to didnt work, using html-pdf npm.
